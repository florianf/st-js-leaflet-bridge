ST-JS bridge for Leaflet map library.
=====================================

+ Fairly complete mapping of all classes
+ Leaflet lives in standard namespace L, but can be easyily changed in class [LeafletNamespace.java]{https://github.com/florianf/st-js-leaflet-bridge/blob/master/src/main/java/org/stjs/javascript/leaflet/LeafletNamespace.java}
+ Factory methods like L.marker are not supported, please use the classical constructor method (new Marker)

Please report any problems or bugs you encounter.
